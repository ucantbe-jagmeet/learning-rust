// You have seen code like #[derive(Debug)] before: this type of code is called an attribute. These attributes are small pieces of code that give information to the compiler. They are not easy to create, but they are very easy to use. If you write an attribute with just # then it will affect the code on the next line. But if you write it with #! then it will affect everything in its own space.

struct NumberAndBool {
    number: i32,         // i32 is Copy
    true_or_false: bool, // bool is also Copy. So no problem
}
