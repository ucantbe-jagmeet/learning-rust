//  channel is an easy way to use many threads that send to one place. They are fairly popular because they are pretty simple to put together. You can create a channel in Rust with std::sync::mpsc. mpsc means "multiple producer, single consumer", so "many threads sending to one place". To start a channel, you use channel(). This creates a Sender and a Receiver that are tied together.
