// You can implement the Default trait to give values to a struct or enum that you think will be most common. The builder pattern works nicely with this to let users easily make changes when they want. First let's look at Default. Actually, most general types in Rust already have Default. They are not surprising: 0, "" (empty strings), false, etc.

            Err(err_info) => println!("{}", err_info),
