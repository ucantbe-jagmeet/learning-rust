// If you have a loop inside of a loop, you can give them names. With names, you can tell Rust which loop to break out of. Use ' (called a "tick") and a : to give it a name:

fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;
    let mut counter2 = 0;
    println!("Now entering the first loop.");

    'first_loop: loop {
        // Give the first loop a name
        counter += 1;
        println!("The counter is now: {}", counter);
        if counter >= 5 {
            // Starts a second loop inside this loop
            println!("Now entering the second loop.");

            'second_loop: loop {
                // now we are inside 'second_loop
                println!("The second counter is now: {}", counter2);
                counter2 += 1;
                if counter2 == 3 {
                    break 'first_loop; // Break out of 'first_loop so we can exit the program
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
